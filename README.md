Alexa(Don't Buy!!Build Your Own Alexa)
Module/Library:
A predefined or prewritten code by someone else that we can use in our project for free.

Class:
An OOP concept that allows us to group a bunch of code and is like a blueprint to create objects. This makes a code reusable.

Object:
An instance of a class that can be used to access the attributes and methods of a class.


Alexa Has Only 2 Tasks:
1. Listening
Listening to your command is the most basic functionality of any virtual assistant, like: “Hey Alexa, play music,” “Hey Alexa, what’s the time?”

Alexa has to listen to your command, understand it, and then do some action.

2. Speaking
Once Alexa listens and understands your command, it performs some action based on it. While doing that, it responds to you by speaking otherwise it’ll be jobless.
